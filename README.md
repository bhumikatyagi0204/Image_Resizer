An Image resizer project involves creating a tool to resize images to specified dimensions. 
Users can input an image file and specify the desired width and height, and the tool resizes the image accordingly while preserving its aspect ratio. 
This is useful for tasks like preparing images for web display, email attachments, or social media posts.
